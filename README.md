# Wide-Field, High-Resolution Reconstruction in Computational Multi-Aperture Miniscope using CoordGate Network

## Overview
This project leverages a Microlens Array (MLA)-based optical system to reconstruct high-quality images over a large field of view (FOV), addressing challenges such as image overlap and blurriness. By employing a neural network-based approach incorporating the CoordGate module, this study enhances the spatially variant (SV) deblurring process, achieving high-resolution 2D reconstructions of ground truth objects. The model balances computational efficiency and accuracy, with future applications in 3D deconvolution tasks.

## Problem Statement
Microscopy systems often suffer from spatially variant distortions and blurring due to optical limitations, particularly at the edges of the FOV. These challenges are exacerbated in MLA-based systems where unique distortions arise from each lenslet. Standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fail to handle these localized distortions due to their spatially invariant nature.

To address these challenges:
- **CoordGate** is introduced to incorporate pixel and lenslet coordinates into the convolutional process, enabling linear shift-variant (LSV) convolutions.
- **Positional Encoding** enhances the model's ability to capture complex spatial relationships without significant computational overhead.

## Key Components

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** Modified UNet or ResNet architecture with encoder-decoder structure for multi-scale feature extraction.
- **CoordGate Module:** Incorporates positional information (pixel and lens coordinates) into convolution operations to enable LSV processing.
- **Transformer Integration:** Lightweight Transformer components enhance global spatial dependency understanding.
- **Positional Encoding Techniques:**
  - Sinusoidal Encoding for periodic spatial information.
  - Radial Basis Functions (RBF) for flexible non-linear mappings.

### Data Processing
- **Input:** Nine images from MLA corresponding to distinct lenslets, each with specific distortions.
- **Patch-Wise Processing:** Improves memory efficiency by focusing on localized image details.

### Loss and Metrics
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) for pixel-wise deblurring tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
  - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)

### Framework and Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8
- **Deep Learning Library:** PyTorch 2.4
- **Hardware:** GPU-accelerated training for high-resolution inputs.

## Result

(a) is the Non-linear Free Network provided by the paper Simple Baselines for Image Restoration, consisting of a model with 36 hidden layers. The reconstructed image shows blurred or even missing edge information, which demonstrates that a neural network model based on traditional CNNs cannot accurately predict different point spread functions (PSFs) for different patches without additional positional information.

(b) shows the results generated by a network model enhanced with a CoordConv.  The final results are significantly better than those in (a). However, the generated image still has blurred edge regions, with particular shortcomings in restoring high-frequency details.

(c) shows the results of using the CoordGate. The mask generated by the Coordinate MLP flexibly adjusts the CNN's output, enabling the neural network to learn shift-variant PSFs. At the same time, I reduced the number of hidden layers in the model and used grouped convolutions to decrease the number of parameters.

(d) is the ground truth.

## Literature Review
- **Deconvolution Methods:** Semi-blind methods using training datasets to estimate local PSF variations for MLA systems.
- **CoordGate vs CoordConv:** CoordGate enhances convolutional flexibility for spatially variant data compared to CoordConv.
- **Transformers in Vision:** Potential for long-range spatial modeling but requires lightweight adaptations for efficient deblurring.
